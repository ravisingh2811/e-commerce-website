# e-commerce-website
To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Download the project code as a zip file or use GitHub desktop to clone the project repository.
2. Once downloaded, extract the entire contents of the zip file.
3. Inside the extracted folder, you'll find another folder named "Razorpay-php". Extract the contents of this folder as well.
4. After extracting the "Razorpay-php" folder, you can delete the original zip file.
5. Now, move the "e-commerce-website" folder to the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP server. This is typically located in the installation directory of XAMPP (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs).
6. Next, you'll need to upload the database file to your MySQL database. You can do this using a tool like phpMyAdmin. Create a new database in phpMyAdmin and import the provided database file.
7. Once the database is imported, open the "DBcontroller.php" file inside the "e-commerce-website" folder.
8. In the "DBcontroller.php" file, locate the line where the database name is specified and update it with the name of the database you created in step 6.
9. Start the XAMPP server by launching the XAMPP control panel and clicking the "Start" button next to Apache.
10. Open your web browser and navigate to "localhost/'name of the folder'", where 'name of the folder' is the name of the folder you placed inside the "htdocs" directory.
11. The e-commerce website should now be running, and you can explore it by interacting with the browser interface.

Please note that these instructions assume you have already installed XAMPP and set it up correctly. Adjust the steps accordingly if you're using a different local server environment.
